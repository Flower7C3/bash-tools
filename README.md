# Helpers

## GIT tools
- simplify push and merge, with `bash git-push-n-merge.sh` script
- rename branch on local and remote, with `bash git-rename-branch.sh` script
- rename tag on local and remote, with `bash git-tag-rename.sh` script
- synchronize local from remote, like `git pull` on multiple branches, with `bash git-sync.sh` script
- create tag with annotation, with `bash git-tag-create.sh` script


# Docker
- Connect to Docker container terminal by name with `bash docker-bash.sh <name>` script. Will start container if stopped.
- Read logs from Docker container by name with `bash docker-logs.sh <name>` script. Will start container if stopped.
- Exec command on Docker container with `bash docker-exec.sh <command>` script. Preserve paths.


# Docksal
Simplify Docksal configuration creation with `bash docksal-warmup.sh` script.

# Fun zone

## OSM map to PNG
Download area (by coordinates) with script `bash osm-map-download.sh` and save to PNG image.


## netcatchat
Chat with collegues via netcat with `bash netcatchat.sh`. It contains a lot of shorcuts and saves history.


## beeper (piano music player)
Run `bash beeper.sh` and use keys to generate sound:
- use keyboard keys **zxcvbnm,** to play white piano keys (notes from **C** to **B**)
- use keyboard keys **sdghj** to play on black piano keys
- pley them with **Shift** keyboard key to ativate sustain
- use **Up** and **Down** keyboard arrows to change octave
- use **Left** and **Right** keyboard arrows to change note length
- use keyboard keys **12345** to set note length (sixtennth, eighth, quarter, half, whole)

Use `php piano-notes-to-beeper.php <piano_notes_file_name>` to convert piano notes to beeper format and then call `bash beeper.sh <beeper_file_name>`.

Sound is generated by `beep` (Linux) or `play` (MacOS).
